# First Steps

Once you have ProtonAOSP installed, you don't need to do anything else. The OS works entirely by itself. Enjoy!

If you want to explore all the features, here are some suggestions:

- Check out the wallpapers, clocks, accent colors, and more theming options in Settings -> Display -> Styles & wallpapers
- Block internet access for apps that don't need it
- Try both the light and dark themes
- Try all the ringtone, alarm, or notification sounds included out-of-the-box

Most of ProtonAOSP's improvements work seamlessly in the background, bringing. That means you don't need to change anything -- just flash and forget. See [Features](../discover/features.md) for a list of differences to look for.
