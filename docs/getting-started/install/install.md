# Install

There are multiple ways to install ProtonAOSP on supported devices. We recommend using the [web installer](/install/web) for a quick and easy installation process. It takes as little as 4 minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

## [Web installer (recommended)](/install/web)

This is the recommended method. It's fast, easy, and won't brick your phone. [Install now](/install/web)

## [Manual installation](/install/manual)

You can also install ProtonAOSP manually if you have special requirements or prefer using the command line. This could brick your phone if you mess up, so be careful! [Install manually](/install/manual)
